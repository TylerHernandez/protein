Recently I've been forgetting how much protein I've eaten throughout the day and wanted to keep track of this.
I've gotten to the point where I can eyeball how much protein I eat in a meal, and don't want to use my fitness pal which requires you to enter your food intake rather.
Hence, the 'protein' app. 'protein' is a convenient list app that tracks a user's daily protein intake and sums the total.
